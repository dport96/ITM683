This is an exploration of using AI and an R to explore the question of estimating the average number of drinks per customer from revenue data only.

It is R-notebook markdown. You can copy and paste the contents below into an R-notebook file or download it as text and open in R-Studio as an .Rmd file. 

The exploration assumes you have done the pre-case analytics part 1 indicated in the [Step 3: Process Your Data for Analysis  and Understand Your Data Set](experience-LNHR-step3.html) Experience. In particular, you will need to have the LNHR dataframe with the number of drinks columns.

There are no exercises to questions to answer. It is recommended that you read through the notebook and try the R-code given so you can see the results being discussed. Alternatively you can knit the notebook into a Word or PDF or HTML file which will execute all the code chunks. You can then just read the knitted document with all the results.
