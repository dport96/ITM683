# Practical use of p-values

In practical settings, statistical significance, gauged by p-values, plays a key role in hypothesis testing, yet its application needs careful consideration to avoid misuse and to ensure well-informed decisions,

It's essential to consider the specific situation and context for which the p-value is being interpreted and why it provides sufficient evidence (or does not) to conclude something. Considerations should include assumption violation issues, outliers, and how the hypothesis relates to the problem. Setting alpha to 0.05 is a common default for researchers to control the risk of a Type I error. However, there is nothing magical about 0.05. Depending on the research context, it may be appropriate to set alpha to a different value. The purpose of using statistics is to help make better decisions in the long run. In an industrial setting, that could well mean setting alpha to 0.10 or, in some cases, to 0.20.

The objective of this Reading is to give you a broader understanding on statistical significance and its practical application to decision making.

**First** read these two articles:

1. [Why “Statistical Significance” Is Pointless](https://archive.ph/3DTgM)

2. [In Defense of Statistical Significance](https://goodenoughstatistics.com/in-defense-of-statistical-significance-996e8c62f3e8)

Now we must tackle the pervasive notion that significance is only achieved with p-value less than 0.05:

Now that you have read these articles, you will be better prepared to make practical use of hypothesis testing for informing decision making.
