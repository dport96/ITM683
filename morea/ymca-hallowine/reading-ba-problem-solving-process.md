# Problem Solving and Decision Making  
Business Analytics represents only a portion of the overall problem solving and decision making process.

## Decision Models  
**Deterministic** - prescriptive models have inputs that are known with certainty.  
**Stochastic** - prescriptive models have one or more inputs that are not known with certainty.  
**Algorithms** - are systematic procedures used to find optimal solutions to decision models.  
**Search algorithms** - are used for complex problems to find a good solution without guaranteeing an optimal solution.

## Six Steps in Problem Solving Process  
### Step 1. Recognizing the problem  
* Problems exist when there is a gap between what is happening and what we think should be happening.  
* For example, costs are too high compared with competitors.

### Step 2. Defining the problem
* Clearly defining the problem is not a trivial task.
* Complexity increases when the following occur:
   * large number of courses of action
   * several competing objectives
   * external groups are affected
   * problem owner and problem solver are not the same person
   * time constraints exist

### Step 3. Structuring the problem
* Stating goals and objectives
* Characterizing the possible decisions
* Identifying any constraints or restrictions

### Step 4. Analyzing the problem
* Identifying and applying appropriate Business Analytics techniques
* Typically involves experimentation, statistical analysis, or a solution process

### Step 5. Interpreting Results and Making a Decision
* Managers interpret the results from the analysis phase.
* Incorporate subjective judgment as needed.
* Understand limitations and model assumptions.
* Make a decision utilizing the above information.

### Step 6. Implementing the solution
* Translate the results of the model back to the real world.
* Make the solution work in the organization by providing adequate training and resources.
