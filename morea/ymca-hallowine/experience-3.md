# Performance Reports  
## Instructions  
- Use descriptive statistics (stats, tables, charts etc.) to describe the performance problems indicated by each heading below.While doing this exercise, 
- USE THE PREPARED DATA ONLY (from the previous exercise)! Make adjustments and corrections to it as needed.  
- The most important thing here is to interpret the answers to the questions in a meaningful and useful way with respect to the performance issue.

### Performance report of P1: Items went unsold. 
1. What percent of items went unsold in total?
2. How much opportunity loss did this result in?
3. Was unsold due to having too many items in the auction?
4. What categories contributed to the largest majority of unsold items?
5. How much opportunity loss from unsold items by category did this result in?
6. What categories were problematic (and why are they problematic) with respect to unsold items relative to percent of unsold items and OL from unsold items? Look at the risk loss (% undersold x OL)  
 
### Performance report of P2: Some items were undersold (sold less than 40% of their value). 
1. Should we include unsold as undersold here?
2. What percent of items were undersold in total?
3. How much opportunity loss did this result in?
4. What categories contributed to the largest majority of undersold items?
5. How much opportunity loss by category did this result in?
6. What categories with a high percentage of undersold items were problematic (and why are they problematic) relative to categories with a small percentage of undersold items? Look at the risk loss (% undersold x OL)
 
### Performance report of P3: Difficulty to assess which item to accept or turn away based on the size, value, and quantity.
1. For donated items, what percentage was unsold and what was the OL for these?
2. For donated items, what percentage was undersold and what was the OL for these?
3. For donated items, what was the interest (bids) in them? How much of a draw to the auction attendees? (compare interest in donated items to all items)
4. For donated items, was there an unreasonable distribution of sizes? E.g. too many very large items [Plot the distribution of size and explain what we might expect ideally versus what we see, compare box plots of OL for sizes - is there a notable difference for any sizes?]
5. For donated items, what items (not categories) should have been turned away (and why)? What was the total opportunity loss from not turning away these items? [Sum the OL for the items listed]
 
### Performance report of P4:  Priorities for soliciting donations were unclear relative to auction goals.
1. Did solicited items perform better than donated items in terms of unsold, undersold, interest, and OL?
2. For solicited items, describe the Pareto (topmost number of items categories, bottom most number of items categories) of the number of items in each category in the auction. Describe Pareto of value by category. Describe Pareto of sales by category.
3. For solicited items, what was the total value of all the items in the auction? What was the total sales for the auction? In terms of funds raised, did the auction perform better than asking for cash donations for the items?
4. For solicited items, what was the total opportunity loss (this may not be a loss) for auction? (consider OL from unsold items and undersold items). Do this by category.
5. For solicited items, did higher average value categories have more items? Did higher %sold categories have more items? Did higher average interest categories have more items? Did higher average sales/value categories have more items? Did higher average sales price categories have more items? Did lower average OL categories have more items?
6. For solicited items, was size an issue? Compare sizes of solicited with donated items and see if there are notable differences

### Performance report of P5 and P8: Some item’s mid bid or increment was ignored (not enforced) or not set. 
1. How many (absolute and percent of total) items sold under the min bid? About how many items ignored the increment?
2. By category, of sold items, what is the opportunity loss for not enforcing the min bid? What was the total opportunity loss in the auction for not enforcing the min bid? (Look the difference between sales price and min bid for items sold under the min bid)
3. What was the effect from not enforcing the increment? [Compare sales/value from items that ignored increment with those that did not. Use tables and box plots]
4. Did not having a min bid affect sales/value? [Compare sales/value from items with a min bid which those that did not. Use only sold items even if they sold under the min bid]
5. Did not having a mid bid affect interest? [Compare interest from items with a min bid which those that did not. Use only sold items even if they are sold under the min bid.]
 
### Performance report of P6 and P7: Policy for setting the mid bid or increment negatively affected sales, sales/value, or interest 
1. Check that min bid and increment are predominantly set based on the items value. (look at a scatter plot of value versus min bid and a scatterplot of value versus increment).
2. When looking at the effect of min bid and increment, why should we look at Value – Min Bid or Min Bid / Value and similarly for increment and how do you interpret Value – Min Bid or Min Bid / Value? (start by verifying that higher value items sell for more using a scatterplot then consider what Value – Min Bid or Min Bid / Value can tell us given the relationship between value and sales price)
3. We want to see the effectiveness of value in the min bid. If the difference between value and min bid is too small then people think they aren’t getting a bargain. If we set the min bid correctly, the sales price should increase with a larger difference between value and min bid. As value - min bid increases, so does the value. The min bid is set reasonably. The higher the value of the item, reconsider the difference between value and min bid.
4. Did a higher min bid result in higher sales price? Did a higher Value - Min Bid result in a higher sales price?
5. Did a higher increment result in higher sales price? Did a higher Min Bid - Increment result in a higher sales price? Did a higher Increment/Mid Bid result in a higher sales price?
6. Did a higher min bid result in higher sales/value? Did a larger increment result in higher sales/value?
7. Since we have a positive slope, we know that as value*min bid increases, so does sales.
8. Did the increment affect the likelihood of an item selling? Did the min bid affect the likelihood of an item selling?
9. Did the value affect the interest (number of bids)? Did value affect the likelihood of an item selling?
10. Did the value - min bid affect the interest (number of bids)? Did the increment affect the interest (number of bids)?
11. Was min bid and increment set the same for all categories? [Look at min bid versus value for all the different categories]
12. Was the setting of min bid and increment effective in getting sales/value over 40%? Were there categories that we may want to set the min bid and increment differently? (For each category look at how many items sold for at least the min bid, how many items sold for less than 40% sales/value, and how many sold for at least the min bid but less than 40% sales/value)
 
### Performance report of P9: The auction list is missing data for minimum bid or value of the items. 
1. How many items had missing data? What impact did this have on the sales price of the items? Sales/value? Interest? (compare sales for similar items with no missing data)

### Behavior of the auction:
1. What is the general performance and behavior of the auction?
