# Defining the problem
* What decisions need to be made?
* What are the factors involved in making the decisions?
* What questions do I need to ask to address to make the decisions?
* What would sufficient answers to these questions look like?
* Describe the data that is available (define the variables, kind of data, type of data). Do you have variables for each of the factors in the decisions to be made? What, if anything, is missing?

Silent auctions provide valuable insights into fundraising efforts and donor engagement. Understanding how to prepare and analyze data from a silent auction is crucial for optimizing future events and maximizing revenue.

## Data Preparation
### Step 1. Data Errors and Duplicated Data
Identify and fix errors in the dataset, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Remove duplicate entries while preserving valid duplicate items.
### Step 2. Adding Missing Data and Variables
Fill in missing data for items that were not recorded in error. Add necessary variables to indicate item presence in the auction.
### Step 3. Categorizing Items
Sort items by description and category, ensuring accurate classification and categorization. Address miscategorized items and assign them to the correct category.
## Data Analysis
### Step 1. Descriptive Statistics: Part 1
Calculate summary measures and create charts to answer key questions such as the number of items in the auction, distribution by category, and total sales.
### Step 2. Descriptive Statistics: Part 2
Analyze total revenue by category, top performers in terms of sales, and distribution of value by category. Explore insights into bidder interest, unsold items, and undersold items.
### Step 3. Exploring Relationships
Investigate correlations between variables such as sales price, value, minimum bid, and increment. Understand the impact of these variables on auction outcomes and decision-making processes.
