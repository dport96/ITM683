# Overview:     
The Windward YMCA in Kailua, HI holds an annual fundraising event every Halloween called Hallow-wine. Businesses and individuals donate items to offer at a silent auction. There is also a team that goes out to solicit donations (usually from businesses) for the auction or get cash donations. The objective is to raise as many funds from the event as possible. The silent auction raises money from the sale of donated items and increases ticket sales to attend Hallow-wine. Due to limited space and management overhead, they can only offer a limited number of items at the auction. Items that do not get bid on at the auction are given away, given back to the donors, or thrown out (i.e. no salvage value). However, generally, a donor is willing to give a cash donation of approximately 40% of the value of the item in lieu of donating the item. Executive Director Bill Hastings has a spreadsheet of items for the auction in the previous year but is unsure how to make use of this data to help improve the management of the auction and fundraising results this year. His goals are to make the acution more profitable, higher attendence of the event, and reduce overhead/waste of donated items and opportunities to obtain cash donations.
