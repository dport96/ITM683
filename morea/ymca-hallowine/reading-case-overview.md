# Overview:     
The Windward YMCA in Kailua, HI holds an annual fundraising event every Halloween called Hallow-wine. Businesses and individuals donate items to offer at a silent auction. There is also a team that goes out to solicit donations (usually from businesses) for the auction or get cash donations. The objective is to raise as many funds from the event as possible. The silent auction raises money from the sale of donated items and increases ticket sales to attend Hallow-wine. Due to limited space and management overhead, they can only offer a limited number of items at the auction. Items that do not get bid on at the auction are given away, given back to the donors, or thrown out (i.e. no salvage value). However, generally, a donor is willing to give a cash donation of approximately 40% of the value of the item in lieu of donating the item. Executive Director Bill Hastings has a spreadsheet of items for the auction in the previous year but is unsure how to make use of this data to help improve the management of the auction and fundraising results this year. His goals are to make the auction more profitable, higher attendance of the event, and reduce overhead/waste of donated items and opportunities to obtain cash donations.

## Business Analytics Problem Solving Process  

### Step 1. Recognizing the problem
- What is the gap between what happened previously and what is wanted now?
- What background knowledge is needed?
- How can you describe past performance?
- What problems from the previous auction need to be addressed for the upcoming auction?

### Step 2. Defining the problem  
- What decisions need to be made?
- What are the factors involved in making the decisions?
- What questions do I need to ask to address to make the decisions?
- What would sufficient answers to these questions look like?
- Describe the data that is available (define the variables, kind of data, type of data). Do you have variables for each of the factors in the decisions to be made? What, if anything, is missing?

### Step 3. Structuring the problem
- What is the decision criteria or strategy for the decisions to be made? (goals, constraints, etc.)
- How do answers to the questions relate to the decision?
- What data analysis need to be made to answer the questions?
- Is data is needed and is it practical to obtain?
- Is the data provided sufficient to answer the questions (kind of data, amount, quality, etc.)?

### Step 4. Analyzing the problem
- What models and techniques are needed to address the questions?
- What is the best representation to plot a distribution?
- What are the assumptions we need to make?
- Are the assumptions reasonable? How will they affect our models?

### Step 5. Interpreting Results and Making a Decision
- How do we incorporate how confident can we be in our results?
- What key assumptions were made and how does the degree we think they are valid affect these results?
- What cautionary considerations must be communicated?

### Step 6. Implementing the solution
- How will the analysis results be used to make the decisions?
- What resources or limitations do we need to consider?

## Questions to Answer:  
  * What is the problem(s) Bill is trying to solve?
  * With the given data, what are key metrics to look for to solve this problem? Explain why those metrics are important.
  * How confident can you be that your chosen metrics are significant to addressing Bill’s problem?
  * Give a brief explanation of any exceptions or events that may cause your solution to be less effective.
  * State at least one action Bill can take for this year’s Hallo-wine auction, that is based on last year’s data, and will increase the amount of money raised.
