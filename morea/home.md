## ITM 683: Business Intelligence and Data analytics

This course will explore the fundamental practices of analytics for acquiring business intelligence (BI). BI is used as input for human decisions or may drive fully automated decisions based on why some data pattern is observed, what will happen next, and how a firm can adapt to optimize that outcome. Merging developments in marketing and customer analytics with operations research, and aspects of information systems and desktop data analytics tools, the course offers a technical, quantitative program designed to hone your skill in turning data into business solutions and enable you to utilize prevalent analytics tools and methods.

Real business problems are messy and often poorly defined. The factors are generally uncertain and difficult to use for confident decision-making. BI provides practical and powerful ways to address real business problems universal in all areas of business be it management, accounting, finance, marketing, as well as MIS. Strong data analysis skills and confidence in business modeling, reporting, and decision-making under uncertainty is a key competitive advantage in today’s data-driven business environment. This course will develop your confidence to seek out practical solutions to quantitative business modeling and decision problems using the abundance of available tools (such as Excel, R, and Rapid Miner) right on your laptop. We will explore and utilize large language model (LLM) AI such as ChatGBT and Co-pilot for data modeling, data analyses, and data reporting.

This is not a math, computer science, or data science course! The objective of this course is to become an "educated" participant in business analytics. You will workshop with practical business case studies for common business problems such as cost-benefit analysis, ROI, sales demand, resource allocation, forecasting, risk management, and employee assessment. You will have hands-on experience in developing and analyzing models, methods, and using tools for performing descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics that can be used to address everyday business challenges. You will learn to effectively communicate with data scientists, data engineers, and professional data analytics consultants and understand how analytics provide insight into real-world business problems. You will experience using advanced data analytics concepts such as machine learning accessible and enable you to make use of the analytics tools currently available.  

Throughout the class you will explore contemporary interests in Data Analytics and include:

*   Data acquisition and manipulation
*   Decision-making under uncertainty
*   Regression: general linear model, logistic regression, robust regression
*   Classification, discrimination, clustering
*   Machine Learning: supervised, unsupervised
*   Monte Carlo simulation
*   Small-data analytics
*   Big data visualization
*   Dealing with dirty and missing data
*   Data smoothing and modeling
*   Structural equation modeling
*   Linear and Non-linear optimization
*   Text mining
*   Network analysis
*   Using popular analytics tools (e.g. R, Python, Tableau, Rapid-Miner)
*   AI driven data analysis
*   AI driven data reporting
*   AI for data preparation and validation

The course culminates in a non-trivial unstructured real-world project of your choice making use of contemporary Data Analytics that you will put in your portfolio of business analytics experience. 

## Who should take this course

This course is intended for graduate students who want to experience real-world data analytics for generating business intelligence. A graduate level course in business statistics such as BUS 619 or equivalent and a high degree of comfort working with Excel and "analytics maturity" is expected. Beyond this, no programming or extensive quantitative/math background is required.

## Pedagogy

ITM 683 is structured as a collection of case-study [modules](/modules). Each module will take a varying amount of time to complete. Each module has the following structure:

  * [Prerequisites](/prerequisites), describing things you should have prior to starting the module.
  * [Learning outcomes](/outcomes), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings and other online resources](/readings), providing background material.
  * [Experiential learning activities](/experiences), providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * [Assessments](/assessments), which help you determine if you have acquired mastery of the material.

## Grading:

Grading will be based on the completion of case study exercises and a real-world project. There are no exams. Students may select from a number of available projects or propose something of interest or relevance.

**Tentative Grading breakdown\***

Exercises: 20%

Case Study Reports: 30%

Final Project: 30%

Class participation: 15%

Contemporary business analytics report: 5%

\* breakdown will be adjusted to accommodate possible changes to the focus of the course
