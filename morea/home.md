## ITM 683: Business Intelligence and Data analytics

This course delves into the core practices of analytics for deriving business intelligence (BI), a critical input for informed decision-making. BI can guide human decisions or drive fully automated actions by answering key questions such as: 
- why a particular data pattern is observed, 
- what is likely to happen next, 
- how an organiztion can adapt to optimize outcomes. 

By integrating advancements in marketing and customer analytics with operations research, information systems, and desktop data analytics tools, this course offers a technical and quantitative approach to refining your ability to transform data into actionable business solutions. You will also learn to leverage prevalent analytics tools, methods, and generative AI  effectively.

Business problems are often complex and poorly defined, with factors that are uncertain and challenging to use for confident decision-making. BI offers practical and powerful strategies for tackling these issues, which are common across various business domains, including management, accounting, finance, marketing, and MIS. In today’s data-driven environment, strong data analysis skills and confidence in business modeling, reporting, and decision-making under uncertainty provide a significant competitive advantage. This course aims to build your ability to address quantitative business modeling and decision-making problems using widely available tools like Excel, R, and RapidMiner. Additionally, you will explore and utilize advanced AI tools, including large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Copilot, for data modeling, analysis, and reporting.

This is *not* a math, computer science, or data science course. Instead, it is designed to help you become an informed and skilled participant in business analytics. Through practical business case studies, you will tackle common challenges such as cost-benefit analysis, ROI, sales forecasting, resource allocation, risk management, and employee evaluation. You will gain hands-on experience in developing and analyzing models, applying methods, and using tools to perform descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics that address everyday business challenges.

By the end of the course, you will be equipped to communicate effectively with data scientists, data engineers, and professional analytics consultants. You will understand how analytics provide insights into real-world business problems and gain experience with advanced concepts such as machine learning. Importantly, you will learn to harness the power of current analytics tools, making advanced data analysis accessible and practical for solving business problems.

Throughout the class you will explore contemporary issues in Data Analytics and include:

*   Data acquisition and manipulation
*   Decision-making under uncertainty
*   Regression: general linear model, logistic regression, robust regression
*   Classification, discrimination, clustering
*   Machine Learning: supervised, unsupervised
*   Monte Carlo simulation
*   Small-data analytics
*   Big data visualization
*   Dealing with dirty and missing data
*   Data smoothing and modeling
*   Structural equation modeling
*   Linear and Non-linear optimization
*   Text mining
*   Network analysis
*   Using popular analytics tools (e.g. R, Python, Tableau, Rapid-Miner)
*   AI driven data analysis
*   AI driven data reporting
*   AI for data preparation and validation

The course culminates in a non-trivial unstructured real-world project of your choice making use of contemporary Data Analytics that you will put in your portfolio of business analytics experience. 

## Who should take this course

This course is intended for graduate students who want to experience real-world data analytics for generating business intelligence. A graduate level course in business statistics such as BUS 619 or equivalent and a high degree of comfort working with Excel and "analytics maturity" is expected. Beyond this, no programming or extensive quantitative/math background is required.

## Pedagogy

ITM 683 is structured as a collection of case-study [modules](/modules). Each module will take a varying amount of time to complete. Each module has the following structure:

  * [Prerequisites](/prerequisites), describing things you should have prior to starting the module.
  * [Learning outcomes](/outcomes), describing the major goals for the module.
  * [Readings and other online resources](/readings), providing background material.
  * [Experiential learning activities](/experiences), providing a structured set of challenges enabling you to acquire mastery of material.
  * [Assessments](/assessments), which help you determine if you have acquired mastery of the material.

## Grading:

Grading will be based on the completion of case study exercises and a real-world project. There are no exams. Students may select from a number of available projects or propose something of interest or relevance.

**Tentative Grading breakdown\***

Exercises: 20%

Case Study Reports: 30%

Final Project: 30%

Class participation: 15%

Contemporary business analytics report: 5%

\* breakdown will be adjusted to accommodate possible changes to the focus of the course
