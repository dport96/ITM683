# Objective:
This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of business analytics by exploring how data-driven decisions are applied in real-world scenarios. You will research a real-world business analytics problem, analyze how it was addressed, and evaluate the outcomes. This exercise will enhance your ability to connect theoretical concepts with practical applications.

# Instructions:
First, make sure you have read the HBR article [4 EXAMPLES OF BUSINESS ANALYTICS IN ACTION](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/business-analytics-examples) 

then, find a non-trivial "real" business analytics example from your work or other business-oriented function. For this example, report in terms of issues and language discussed [Exploring Business Analytics](experience-exploring-bi-analytics.html) similar to the examples given in the HBR article [4 EXAMPLES OF BUSINESS ANALYTICS IN ACTION](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/business-analytics-examples). However, you **must** use the following outline **exactly** and address each of the sections bullet points **completely**:

**I. Purpose of the analytics**

- Give a brief overview of the company/organization
- What business questions or problems are addressed? 
- What decision(s) are supported? 
- Who does/did the analysis? Who uses the results? How are they used?

**II. Data used and the source of the data.**

- What are the variables? 
- What data types are they? 
- Where does the data come from?

**III. Analytics used**

- Discuss what types of models are used: descriptive, predictive, prescriptive. 
- What methods are used and what are they used for? (e.g. trend analysis, maximizing profit, risk assessment, etc.)

**IV. Value of the analytics to the business**

- What are the expectations from using the analytics? 
- Have the analytics proven valuable? 
- How is this measured?

**_The challenge is to be as clear and specific as possible. You do not need to **do** any analytics here or determine how to address the problem if it’s not already done. Be wary of “vague weasel words and phrases” e.g. We want to determine the appropriate staffing level._**



**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Submission Instructions</span>**

Your report may be in any format (written report, presentation, etc.) so long as it addresses the areas I - V indicated above. You may be asked to give a 5-10 min report to the class (again, any format you wish so long as it covers the areas indicated). When presenting to the class be sure to leave time for some questions and discussion. You are encouraged to ask questions of the class about your business analytics problem.

Some of you may be a little lost in finding real-world business analytics to report on. This is understandable given we have only just begun discussing what business analytics is and you are not familiar enough with the practice yet. Try to find something you are involved with or have a connection to rather than reporting on some companies analytics. 

Avoid generic situations or case studies you find on the web (especially tutorials). Such things are unacceptable for this assignment. You are welcome to report on use of analytics tools, but only in the context of how they are used for the business analytics you are reporting on. Reporting on a specific analytics tool only does not satisfy the requirements of this assignment. 

Here are some suggestions for finding real-world business analytics to report on:

- Ask your manager/boss about data-driven decisions they make (or would like to make) and how they make them. If you don't have a boss, ask someone in business you know.

- Are you a member of a club, church, or activity group (such as a **sports team** or hobby group like Hula dancing)? What data-driven decisions are made (or would like to be made) here?

- Is there something you are personally interested in that would require data-driven decision-making? For example, have you thought about starting a business? What decisions would have to be made for this business or to start the business?

- Google "business analytics case studies" and see if anything interesting pops up  

## Use of AI:
You are encouraged to use generative AI to help you with this assignment. Under no circumstances it is acceptable to ask AI to generate an example.Your report must be on a real business analytics situation, not made up by AI. It also unacceptable to simply copy responses you get from AI. You must carefully review and edit anything generated by AI. Any indication of such uses will result in an automatic, non-negotiable zero for this assignment.

Some suggested ways to use AI for this assignment include:
- Ask AI to explain what kind of analytics something is (i.e. prescriptive, descriptive, predictive)
- Use AI Content Generation Tools: Tools like ChatGPT or Jasper AI can help draft and refine your report sections (e.g., introduction, value analysis). Provide AI with structured inputs, such as bullet points or raw insights, and let it generate polished paragraphs.
- Summarization: Use AI to condense lengthy technical results or literature into concise, actionable insights for the report.
- Use AI to find related works or find references 
- Use AI to explain how methods apply to a given situation or provide examples that do not divulge propriety or inaccessible data.
