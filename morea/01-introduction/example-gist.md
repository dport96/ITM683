# Experience Real-World Business Analytics

First, make sure you have read the HBR article [4 EXAMPLES OF BUSINESS ANALYTICS IN ACTION](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/business-analytics-examples)

then, find a non-trivial "real" business analytics example from your work or other business-oriented function. For this example, report in terms of issues and language discussed [Exploring Business Analytics](Exploring_BA.pptx) using the following outline:

**I. Purpose of the analytics**

What business questions are addressed? What decision(s) are supported? Who does the analysis? Who uses the results? How are they used?

**II. Data used and the source of the data.**

What are the variables? What data types are they? Where does the data come from?

**III. Analytics used**

Types of models - descriptive, predictive, prescriptive). Tools used.

What are they used for? (e.g. trend analysis, maximizing profit, risk assessment, etc.)

**IV. Value of the analytics to the business**

What are the expectations from using the analytics? Have the analytics proven valuable? How is this measured?



**_The challenge is to be as clear and specific as possible. You do not need to “do” any analytics here or determine how to address the problem if it’s not already done. Be wary of “vague weasel words and phrases” e.g. We want to determine the appropriate staffing level._**



**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Submission Instructions</span>**

Your report may be in any format (written report, presentation, etc.) so long as it addresses the areas I - V indicated above. You may be asked to give a 5-10 min report to the class (again, any format you wish so long as it covers the areas indicated). When presenting to the class be sure to leave time for some questions and discussion. You are encouraged to ask questions of the class about your business analytics problem.





Some of you may be a little lost in finding real-world business analytics to report on. This is understandable given we have only just begun discussing what business analytics is and you are not familiar enough with the practice yet.  Here are some suggestions for finding real-world business analytics to report on:

- Ask your manager/boss about data-driven decisions they make (or would like to make) and how they make them. If you don't have a boss, ask someone in business you know.

- Are you a member of a club, church, or activity group (such as a **sports team** or hobby group like Hula dancing)? What data-driven decisions are made (or would like to be made) here?

- Is there something you are personally interested in that would require data-driven decision-making? For example, have you thought about starting a business? What decisions would have to be made for this business or to start the business?

- Google "business analytics case studies" and see if anything interesting pops up
