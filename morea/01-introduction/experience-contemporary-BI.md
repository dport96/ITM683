## Use of AI:
You are encouraged to use generative AI to help you with this assignment. Under no circumstances it is acceptable to ask AI to generate an example.Your report must be on a real business analytics situation, not made up by AI. It also unacceptable to simply copy responses you get from AI. You must carefully review and edit anything generated by AI. Any indication of such uses will result in an automatic, non-negotiable zero for this assignment.

2. Data Analysis and Visualization
- Utilize AI-driven analytics tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio) to analyze datasets related to or provide examples for the chosen topic. 
- Use AI to generate visualizations, such as graphs, heatmaps, and trend charts, to enhance the clarity of your presentation.
3. Presentation Enhancement
- Use AI-powered slide design tools (e.g., Canva, Beautiful.ai) to create engaging and professional presentations. 
- AI tools like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot can help draft key talking points and refine explanations. 
- AI speech coaching tools (e.g., Yoodli, Speeko) can provide feedback on presentation delivery and pacing.
4. AI for Critical Thinking and Discussion
- Ask AI to challenge your perspective by providing counterarguments or alternative viewpoints on your topic.
- Use AI-generated discussion questions to anticipate possible questions from the class and prepare responses.
5. Writing and Proofreading
